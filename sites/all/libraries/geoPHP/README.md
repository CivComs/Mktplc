GeoPHP is a open-source native PHP library for doing geometry operations. It is written entirely in PHP and 
can therefore run on shared hosts. It can read and write a wide variety of formats (WKT, WKB, GeoJSON, 
KML, GPX). It works with all Simple-Feature geometries (Point, LineString, Polygon, GeometryCollection etc.)
and can be used to get centroids, bounding-boxes, area, and a wide variety of other useful information. 

geoPHP also helpfully wraps the GEOS php extension so that applications can get a transparent performance 
increase when GEOS is installed on the server. When GEOS is installed, geoPHP also becomes
fully compliant with the OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information. This means that
you get the full-set of openGIS functions in PHP like Union, IsWithin, Touches etc. 

Applications get a useful "core-set" of geometry operations that work in all environments, and an "extended-set"
of operations for environments that have GEOS installed. As time and resources allow we will be porting as much as
possible to native PHP to enable more operations on hosts without GEOS.

See the 'getting started' section below for references and examples of everything that geoPHP can do.

This project is currently looking for co-maintainers. If you think you can help out, please send me a 
message. Forks are also welcome, please issue pull requests and I will merge them into the main branch.

Getting Started

Example usage
-------------------------------------------------

    include_once('geoPHP.inc');
    
    // Polygon WKT example
    $polygon = geoPHP::load('POLYGON((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2,2 3,3 3,3 2,2 2))','wkt');
    $area = $polygon->getArea();
    $centroid = $polygon->getCentroid();
    $centX = $centroid->getX();
    $centY = $centroid->getY();
    
    print "This polygon has an area of ".$area." and a centroid with X=".$centX." and Y=".$centY;
    
    // MultiPoint json example
    print "<br/>";
    $json = 
    '{
       "type": "MultiPoint",
       "coordinates": [
           [100.0, 0.0], [101.0, 1.0]
       ]
    }';
    
    $multipoint = geoPHP::load($json, 'json');
    $multipoint_points = $multipoint->getComponents();
    $first_wkt = $multipoint_points[0]->out('wkt');
    
    print "This multipolygon has ".$multipoint->numGeometries()." points. The first point has a wkt representation of ".$first_wkt;
