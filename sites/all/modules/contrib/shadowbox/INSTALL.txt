1. Follow the usual module installation procedure [1] or use Drush [2].

   [2] http://drupal.org/project/drush

2. Download Shadowbox 3.0 from http://www.shadowbox-js.com/download.html.
   Simply customize it to your needs, jQuery is suggested as the adapter, since it is included in Drupal.

3. Extract the download and place it in sites/all/libraries so you have, for
   example: sites/all/libraries/shadowbox

4. View the status report at admin/reports/status to check that Shadowbox is
   installed correctly.

5. Visit admin/settings/shadowbox to adjust the settings.
