TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Step 1

  If you are experiencing any problems getting Shadowbox to work try clearing
  the cache.

Check for the rel attribute

  Check that the link you expect to open in Shadowbox has the required rel
  attribute with a value of 'shadowbox' or 'lightbox', for example:

  <a href="/path/to/file.jpg" rel="shadowbox">

Interface translation

  Translations for the Shadowbox interface are currently handled by JS files in
  the languages sub-directory of the downloaded Shadowbox distribution. If your
  site uses a language that is not already catered for, you will need to copy, 
  edit and rename one of the related language files to suit your site.

  If a language file is not found for the current language (defined by the
  value of $language->language) English will be used as a fallback.

Check for JavaScript errors

  Check the page in Firefox with Firebug's Console enabled. If there is a
  JavaScript error it will be flagged up in the bottom right hand corner of the
  Firefox window.
  
  It is helpful to provide the error message in any issue posts you might make.

Check the issue queue

  Check the issue queue to see if anyone has posted information about the same
  issue you are experiencing. Don't forget to check the issue queue before
  starting to create a patch for a module as someone might have already done
  some, if not all, of the work for you.

Submit a new issue

  Finally, once you have done all you can to try and fix the problem yourself,
  you may post a new issue in the queue. Please include all the details you can
  think of that might be relevant to the issue. It helps to use a meaningful
  title that concisely expresses the scope of the issue.
