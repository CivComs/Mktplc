USAGE
=====

The module is integrated with image field element so you can select from
a number of different options for displaying images uploaded to nodes and shown
in views. For any image field you can use shadowbox as the formatter of the field.

Shadowbox by default is only used on image fields with shadowbox formatter but you
can configure shadowbox auto handle features if you want to use it in other
different ways:

  - If you want to activate shadowbox automatically in all your links to images you
can activate the "Enable for all image links" checkbox located in module config
auto handling feature, /admin/config/media/shadowbox/automatic

  - If you want all images in a page grouped in a gallery and automatically handle
by shadowbox activate both "Enable for all image links" and "Group images as a
shadowbox gallery" in /admin/config/media/shadowbox/automatic

  - If you want to include shadowbox library in all your pages so you can decide which
links you want opened in a shadowbox using the rel attribute then you must enable the
auto handle feature, "Enable shadowbox globally" that you can locate in
/admin/config/media/shadowbox/automatic.

For instructions on manually crafting links, please see the official usage guide:

If you need to integrate Shadowbox with some other Drupal module it is quite
likely that you can do it on the theme layer.
