This folder is for collecting any patches to modules.  These
are important to keep track of, as often upgrading modules
will blow away any hacks to the code.

Please format patches like so:

<module short name>-<drupal.org node ID>-<comment ID>-<description>.patch

For example:

cc_phone-3948394-2-fixes_tests.patch
